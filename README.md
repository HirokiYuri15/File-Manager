# File Manager

This is a **pythonic** file manager that can keep your important files orgenized and in their intended folders 

How it works: This project uses *pathlib* to perform an operation where a folder gets created out of the extension of each file you have
then move it to it for instence if the file ends with the .txt extension a folder will be created and its name will be TXT 
then the file will be moved to it

to run the program you need to have python installed and 
write either the relative or full path that leads to the folder you want organized

to get the code you can clone this project using git clone HTTPS-URL if you have git installed otherwise download it directly from github

feel free to make some pull requests and see if you can make this better for now I am going to work on integrating this feature
into the ai agent along with other features 

This is my first *real* project on github
